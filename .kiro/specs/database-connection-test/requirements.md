# Database Connection Test Requirements

## Introduction

Create a comprehensive test suite to verify Supabase database connectivity and basic operations. This test will ensure the database connection is working properly and can perform basic CRUD operations on a dedicated test table.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connection Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the Supabase database connection is working, so that I can ensure the application can communicate with the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test runs THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the Supabase database
2. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the connection issue
3. WHEN the test completes THEN the system SHALL verify that authentication and basic database access are functional

### Requirement 2: Test Table Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated test table for connection testing, so that I can perform database operations without affecting production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test runs THEN the system SHALL create a table called 'test-only-test' if it does not exist
2. WHEN the table already exists THEN the system SHALL use the existing table without errors
3. WHEN the test completes THEN the system SHALL leave the test table in place for future test runs

### Requirement 3: Test Data Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to insert and update test data with timestamps, so that I can verify that database write operations are working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test runs THEN the system SHALL insert or update a test record with the message 'Hi, test successfully at <iso date and time>'
2. WHEN inserting data THEN the system SHALL use the current ISO timestamp in the message
3. WHEN the operation completes THEN the system SHALL verify that the data was successfully written to the database
4. WHEN reading the data back THEN the system SHALL confirm the test message contains the correct timestamp format

### Requirement 4: Test Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database connection test to integrate with the existing test suite, so that it runs alongside other tests and follows the same patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the database connection test SHALL be included in the test execution
2. WHEN the test runs THEN it SHALL follow the same testing patterns as existing Supabase tests
3. WHEN the test fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages that help diagnose database connectivity issues
4. WHEN the test passes THEN it SHALL confirm successful database operations with appropriate assertions
